### Alternate Subnautica APworld

WARNING: unless you have been specifically directed here you've likely stumbled across this in error. You should likely play Archipelago's built-in Subnautica, not this alternate version. Consider yourself warned.

<details>
<summary>How to use this APworld</summary>

This apworld is meant to be used with [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago) and a custom [SubnauticMod](https://github.com/kedNalatacId/ArchipelagoSubnauticaModSrc).

This apworld can generate "classic" options so that it works with classic subnautica mod which allows playing the custom and non-custom subnautica side by side inside the same archipelago instance.

### Using this alternate apworld

For the moment, the way to use this apworld is as follows:
  - clone a copy of this repo
  - zip the contents of the repo as subnautica.apworld
  - move the apworld into the archipelago custom_worlds folder
    - if a custom_worlds folder doesn't exist, create one or run `python3 Generate.py -h` and it should be created automatically
    - the custome apworld should have precedence over the built-in

### Disabling this alternate apworld

To stop using the alternate, simply delete the subnautica.apworld from the custom_worlds folder.
